# University Medical Center Database Project

## Overview

This repository hosts the comprehensive database system designed for the Patient Access and Registration branch of the University Medical Center. The primary aim is to streamline patient management from admission through discharge, enhancing care coordination, patient care quality, error reduction, and optimal utilization of resources.

## Project Objectives

- **Efficient Patient Management**: Create a seamless workflow to manage patient information, reducing wait times and improving patient experience.
- **Enhanced Care Coordination**: Facilitate communication and information sharing among healthcare providers.
- **Error Reduction**: Implement data integrity and validation rules to minimize errors in patient information and treatment records.
- **Resource Optimization**: Analyze patient flow and resource allocation to improve hospital operations.

## Contents

- **UniversityMedicalCenterDatabaseProject.pdf**: A detailed project report that outlines the database design, implementation, testing phases, and the conclusions drawn from the development process.

## Detailed Sections

### Database Design

The database schema is crafted to encapsulate various facets of hospital management, including but not limited to:

- Patient Records
- Employee Information
- Department Details
- Medical Procedures and Medications
- Billing and Insurance

Each aspect is thoroughly documented, illustrating the thought process behind table structures, relationships, and constraints to ensure data integrity and accessibility.

### Implementation and Testing

This section delves into the SQL scripts for:

- Table creation and schema definition
- Data insertion for sample records
- Definition of views, triggers, functions, and stored procedures to encapsulate complex queries and operations
- Transaction management to ensure data consistency

Real-world scenarios are simulated to test the database's resilience and efficiency, with findings and optimizations discussed in detail.

### Conclusions and Future Work

Reflecting on the project's objectives versus outcomes, this section evaluates the database system's impact on operational efficiency and patient care quality. Potential areas for further development, including the integration of new technologies and approaches for scalability and performance enhancement, are explored.
